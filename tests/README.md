Howdy!

This directory contains a small fragment of a lookup table as
`lutleft.bmp`, and each `.json` file contais just enough markings to
reproduce a DRC error or an extraction success.  The resolution is
intentionally low to keep things fast.

The `Makefile` assumes that `maskromtool` is in your path.  This is
probably bad form.
